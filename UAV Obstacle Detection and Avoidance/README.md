# UAV Obstacle Detection and Avoidance

This page primarily focuses on implementing algorithms and sensor fusion techniques to accurately determine the location and geometry of objects using point cloud data. It also explores the implementation of obstacle avoidance techniques through the integration of Lidar and ultrasonic sensors mounted on all four sides of a quadcopter.
